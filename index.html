                                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                                    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                                    people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                                    - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                                    course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
                                    Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
                            from
                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
                            a former
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                            and staff
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                            agile team
                            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                            no tutorial
                            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple offers.
                            100% recommend! ”
